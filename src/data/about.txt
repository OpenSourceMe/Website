I'm originally from Auckland, New Zealand. I'm halfway through an undergraduate education in Computer Science at Princeton University in the U.S., though at the moment I'm taking a year off to live in Rome and wider Italy, to develop software, read some books, write some music. I'm currently working as a Web and iOS Developer for the [Paideia Institute][paideia], and as a non-affiliated student.

For more on what I'm specifically doing in Rome, see [logistics][logistics] and [syllabus][syllabus]. If you want to read the speculative theories that justify my being in Rome for the Authorities that demand reason, see [reasons][reasons].
