<small>note: lyrics have changed slightly since i recorded this demo

a ghost fell from a chimney i <br>
was looking at through drunken eyes <br>
the skin that kept your body <br>
frightened mine

the ghost in evening wore on i <br>
was turned on by the empty eyes <br>
the skin that kept your body <br>
came alive

as i bared your body naked <br>
i was thirsting for its pulse <br>
i'm a madman you're a shadow <br>
and there's no-one else involved <br>
for the others this is all a game <br>
but i took your ghost home

in the dark they call a ballroom i <br>
can steal my glances secretly <br>
cause we were art that i was <br>
there to see

and with desperate digits shaking i <br>
am tearing down this wall of skin <br>
this throbbing will subside when i'm a <br>
skeleton

i have kept your skin a secret <br>
i am hiding from its pulse <br>
i'm a madman you're a shadow <br>
and i wear you when it's cold <br>
for the others this is just a game <br>
but i took your ghost home

when the play was over i <br>
rejoined the crowd to find my mind <br>
my bones were quiet, but <br>
i'm still alive

they are students drunken hungry i <br>
am hidden by the haunted eyes <br>
my bones are quiet, even <br>
in the lights

when i bared my body naked <br>
i couldn't feel its pulse <br>
they are madmen i'm a shadow <br>
and i'm wearing all your souls <br>
come and watch we'll fuck ourselves <br>
the tickets have been sold
