my thoughts are with you in paris

red is the world <br>
white washes the streets <br>
blue are the victims

raise hell through the windows <br>
there is no flight, no eagle, no victory <br>
i am watching water boil

murder at the bataclan <br>
i was delighted that the <br>
chocolate cost me only sixty cents

what if i were the french president <br>
woken by the suicide <br>
and so many new emails

i am not drunk nor despaired <br>
people sing in parliament <br>
i make pasta and put it with pesto

there is blood in their espressos <br>
armed guards to watch the happy hour <br>
my water is ready on the stove

how can they think this is a theatre? <br>
is tragedy an art for them? <br>
can a true god not hear screams in french?

what belief have these people <br>
the illegally in europe <br>
the law that let the horror in

my crisis is hunger <br>
i will not die for my beliefs <br>
i will not die from your bullets

arrest them, war, arrest them <br>
my conscience, beyond the barricade <br>
and i am in aotea

in france it was yesterday <br>
in syria it is now <br>
this is our civilisation

blue are the victims <br>
white washes the streets <br>
red is the world
