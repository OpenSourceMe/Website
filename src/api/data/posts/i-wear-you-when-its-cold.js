  lyrics: 'note: lyrics have changed slightly since i recorded this demo\n\na ghost fell from a chimney i     \nwas looking at through drunken eyes     \nthe skin that kept your body     \nfrightened mine\n\nthe ghost in evening wore on i     \nwas turned on by the empty eyes     \nthe skin that kept your body     \ncame alive\n\nas i bared your body naked     \ni was thirsting for its pulse     \ni\'m a madman you\'re a shadow     \nand there\'s no-one else involved     \nfor the others this is all a game     \nbut i took your ghost home\n\nin the dark they call a ballroom i     \ncan steal my glances secretly     \ncause we were art that i was     \nthere to see\n\nand with desperate digits shaking i     \nam tearing down this wall of skin     \nthis throbbing will subside when i\'m a     \nskeleton\n\ni have kept your skin a secret     \ni am hiding from its pulse     \ni\'m a madman you\'re a shadow     \nand i wear you when it\'s cold     \nfor the others this is just a game     \nbut i took your ghost home\n\nwhen the play was over i     \nrejoined the crowd to find my mind     \nmy bones were quiet, but     \ni\'m still alive\n\nthey are students drunken hungry i     \nam hidden by the haunted eyes     \nmy bones are quiet, even     \nin the lights\n\nwhen i bared my body naked     \ni couldn\'t feel its pulse     \nthey are madmen i\'m a shadow     \nand i\'m wearing all your souls     \ncome and watch we\'ll fuck ourselves     \nthe tickets have been sold',
