note: lyrics have changed slightly since i recorded this demo

a ghost fell from a chimney i
was looking at through drunken eyes
the skin that kept your body
frightened mine

the ghost in evening wore on i
was turned on by the empty eyes
the skin that kept your body
came alive

as i bared your body naked
i was thirsting for its pulse
i'm a madman you're a shadow
and there's no-one else involved
for the others this is all a game
but i took your ghost home

in the dark they call a ballroom i
can steal my glances secretly
cause we were art that i was
there to see

and with desperate digits shaking i
am tearing down this wall of skin
this throbbing will subside when i'm a
skeleton

i have kept your skin a secret
i am hiding from its pulse
i'm a madman you're a shadow
and i wear you when it's cold
for the others this is just a game
but i took your ghost home

when the play was over i
rejoined the crowd to find my mind
my bones were quiet, but
i'm still alive

they are students drunken hungry i
am hidden by the haunted eyes
my bones are quiet, even
in the lights

when i bared my body naked
i couldn't feel its pulse
they are madmen i'm a shadow
and i'm wearing all your souls
come and watch we'll fuck ourselves
the tickets have been sold',
