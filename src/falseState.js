        "content": "i have decided to end my official term with the [paideia institute](http://www.paideiainstitute.org), to freelance full-time. it's possible that i contradict my society's moral expectation of the general ability to commit. i tend to believe that this expectation comes from an anxiety regarding success, and its achievement. i have practiced success as self-consideration for years now, to the extent that i believe i am successful here in frascati, dwindling days away in listening to *eragon*'s audiolibro. i have just started dan brown's *the da vinci code*, which i have never read in english.\n\nduring my time with paideia, i have worked on a number of projects, including the creation of their new [nationbuilder site](https://www.paideiainstitute.org), version 1 of a [latin reader for ios](http://www.paideiainstitute.org/delphin), and a browser extension for translating latin and greek (currently [available on chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromium-dictionary/plpakagjcfpanojjijfdcjlklffcfdah), soon to be also available for safari). i've also been writing [python](https://www.python.org/) and [google apps](https://www.google.com/script/start/) scripts now and then to help out with some of paideia's internal operations.\n\nat least until april 15th, i will be developing a proof-of-concept system for an australian start-up. the following are my choice of technologies:\n\n - a [hapi](http://www.hapijs.com) **server** connected to a [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) database, with [redis](http://redis.io/) cache. accessible via an api endpoint using [jwt](https://jwt.io/) authentication.\n - an **admin web application** using [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for front-end, and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for state management. [server-side rendering](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html) from the hapi api, data pulled via http requests (will perhaps add bidirectional communication via [socket.io](http://socket.io/) at a later stage).\n - an **ios client** that pulls data from the api, using [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). if time constrains / react native challenges, i may also use native [swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) components.\n - a basic **andriod client** that pulls data from the api. hopefully will not have to write native [java](http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/package-summary.html), as i have very limited experience with android development per se.\n\ni have a couple of smaller gigs outside of this core project, including a [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) site and another react-redux app.\n\ni live now in [frascati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frascati), a little town just outside of rome, and in march will be moving to [nepi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepi). i currently live with three italian nurses (male), and get my culinary goods from the [eurospin](http://www.eurospin.it/) that lies twenty paces from my front door. i have acquired an italian cookbook that i sometimes consult when i cook. more often i just throw vegetables in the pan and experiment with sauces, pastes, pastas. i read or listen to italian for a lot of the day, reviving my childhood in *eragon*, or catching up on pop culture with *il trono di spade* (*game of thrones*). sometimes i go out or play poker with my roommates. the other night we made a big pot of tiramisu in mourning for gianni's failed exam. it is sitting dangerously in the fridge as we speak.\n\ni am [still attempting](http://lachlankermode.com/pieces/2015/12/09/history-falling-apart.html) to read history, via the [penguin history of the world](http://www.amazon.com/The-Penguin-History-World-Edition/dp/1846144434). i have just arrived at the rise of christianity in the western world at the decline of the roman empire, soon to move beyond into this classical past that i have been trapped in for the entirety of my lack of historical education (cf. my winnings in the auckland university latin speaking competition, circa 2012). i also have a copy of david cannanine's *[history beyond our differences](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/11/undivided-past-history-cannadine-review)* on my desk, as well as foster wallace's *[infinite jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest)*, but i have barely opened either.\n\nother ideas floating in my to-do list include an acapella arrangement of *postmodern jukebox*'s [creep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3lF2qEA2cw), a properly constructed (and inevitably poorly curated) online archive of my activities this year (of which i have been keeping track), some proper study of functional programming & machine learning, many of the books listed on the initial syllabus i wrote for this year, and a structured commitment to open source projects.\n\nthis afternoon, i think i will read daenerys' chapter of game of thrones, and then make an ios scaffold for the react native app listed in bullets above. and work out at my standard time in the afternoon.\n"

        "content": "## Section 7\n\n# Reading Comprehension\n\n-----\n\n*You have 10 minutes to complete this section.*\n*Read the following passage thoroughly, and then answer the following questions.*\n\n\n>By introducing the concept of poiesis, and by unearthing the presence of the phenomenon in traditional artisanship, Heidegger is suggesting that even though technological thinking was a possibility in pre-modern society, it was neither the only nor the dominant mode of bringing-forth. So what has changed? Heidegger argues that what is distinctive about enframing as an ordaining of destining is (i) that it “drives out every other possibility of revealing” (*Question Concerning Technology*, pg 332), and (ii) that it covers up revealing as such (more precisely, covers up the concealing-unconcealing character of appropriation), thereby leaving us blind to the fact that technology is, in its essence, a clearing. For Heidegger, these dual features of enframing are intimately tied up with the idea of technology as metaphysics completing itself. He writes: “[a]s a form of truth [clearing] technology is grounded in the history of metaphysics, which is itself a distinctive and up to now the only perceptible phase of the history of Being” (*Letter on Humanism*, pg 244). According to Heidegger, metaphysics conceives of Being as a being. In so doing, metaphysics obscures the concealing-unconcealing dynamic of the essential unfolding of Being, a dynamic that provides the a priori condition for there to be beings. The history of metaphysics is thus equivalent to the history of Western philosophy in which Being as such is passed over, a history that, for Heidegger, culminates in the nihilistic forces of Nietzsche's eternally recurring will-to-power. The totalizing logic of metaphysics involves the view that there is a single clearing (whatever it may be) that constitutes reality. This renders thought insensitive to the fundamental structure of Being, in which any particular clearing is ontologically co-present with the unintelligible plenitude of alternative clearings, the mystery. With this totalizing logic in view, enframing might be thought of as the ordaining of destining that establishes the technological clearing as the one dominant picture, to the exclusion of all others. Hence technology is metaphysics completing itself.[^1]\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n\n**Question 1**\n*Which statement best describes the author's opinion in this passage?*\n\n1. Heidegger should be credited with the invention of poetry (poiesis).\n2. We will only be able to understand Heidegger when our technology is more advanced.\n3. Nietzsche's philosophy is better than Heidegger's.\n4. Neither Nietzsche nor Heidegger should be taken seriously because they were both dirty heathens.\n5. The author was forced by his father to become an academic when all he ever wanted to be as a young boy was a dancer.\n\n**Question 2**\n*In sentence 6, what is meant by the phrase, \"metaphysics concieves of Being as a being\"?*\n\n1. In being redundant, the author is making a joke.\n2. Metaphysics is belittling 'Being' by refusing to capitalize its first letter.\n3. 'Being' is a German word that we are not meant to understand.\n4. The author is demonstrating that Metaphysics is stupid because it does not know how to spell.\n5. The author is demonstrating that Heidegger is stupid because he does not know how to spell.\n\n**Question 3**\n*In sentence 8, which word best replaces \"will-to-power\"?*\n\n1. Twaddle\n2. Fascism\n3. Flatulence\n4. Erectile Dysfunction\n4. Need-To-Pee\n\n**Question 4**\n*According to this passage, what is \"enframing\"?*\n\n1. The process of protecting a picture and putting it on your wall at home.\n2. A euphemism for 'masturbating'.\n3. The Catholic Church's way of tricking you into giving them money.\n4. Blaming someone else for your sins in order to get into Heaven.\n5. The methodology by which pictures are preserved in Heaven.\n\n**Question 5**\n*How do you think Heidegger would react if he read this passage?*\n\n1. He would thoroughly enjoy it, and offer the author a small packet of chocolate for his troubles.\n2. He would spit on the paper in disgust.\n3. He would spit on the paper in disgust, tear it into small, tiny pieces, and throw them at the children skipping past on their way to school.\n4. He would spit on the paper in disgust, tear it into small, tiny pieces, and throw them at the children skipping past on their way to school, and then chase those children down the road covered in flour from his kitchen.\n5. This is a trick question; Heidegger cannot read.\n\n\n\n--------------\n\n[^1]: wheeler, michael. '*martin heidegger*'. '**the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy**'      ed. edward n. zalta, url.

        "content": "A train from Munich central station to Numberg, from which I transfer to a train to Bamberg. An overnight bus last night from Rome. A live, real-time flipped truck on a road in Austria. One MacBook charger left in Rome. A flight missed to Paris, with it one night at an AirBnB and a train route to Bamberg. Overstepping the terms of a personal relationship. Cash expended, paying for a dinner in Nepi, for drinks in Rome, and for the future Mac charger I need to purchase. A less than appreciable hairstyle, courtesy of wilful reaction on tour a month past. The almost-finished continuation of three freelance projects, as they somehow managed to cross the border and continue living in this fading, batterized computer.\n\nA new developing gig, working freelance for a month at [Artirigo](http://www.artirigo.de/en/). A new language, German, reducing me again to square zero. One new friend, met on overnight bus, a German girl from a small town near Neuschwanstein. A manageably good sleep. Reminder burst from a McDonalds paper cup that coffee in non-espresso amounts invigorates. A chapter of Byzantine history. A pumpkin bagel with cream cheese.\n\nI am out of Italy. Part has been played, and I am now working on new material. Rebuilding competence from a different beginning. In search of a swimming pool, having not cleansed in chlorine for almost a year. In search of new fitness, more than anything. Of recreation. Some more sustainable context for returning to my what-was America, than this Italian make-believe; this Mussolini-Hitler, Putin-Donald Trump. I am landed in new ideology, which gives me the opportunity to recreate myself.\n\nLinguistically, I am back at infancy. I am suffering the enervation of one language for the innervation of another. I am thinking of ideology in this way, as well. Both exchanges are not self-contained. The blocking of one for the potential of another is an oversimplified model, but it helps me wrap my head around the micro-complexities -- as a macro-complexity, overlooking smaller nuance for the sake of a simple understanding that can pressure a direction, action, free will.\n\nI am here to practice working in a startup environment. I am here to get my feet wet with German. I am here to become fit again. I am here running through the sprinklers of the German tech sector. I am here to rethink my 8 months in Italy, outside of itself and myself -- because I imagine I will return to some old inside thought-politik when I return to Princeton in May. I am here to reimagine the year, myself, my education, my career (why must a career be mine?).\n\nI do not have to meet people or make friends with them inside these ideas. I sometimes find those dearer who are a part of ideology's excess. Lips leaning on another's on the verge of departure, meaning where we have been told not to find it. Sometimes I think I can *only* find meaning where I have been told not to. Where it does not exist, and so I can imagine it on our own terms. Where love is lost, where lyrics lie, where I pretend to know something I don't: case and point.\n\n"

        "content": "but it was actually iron[^exp]. I don’t think I put enough ginger in this stew. Perhaps it needs more salt. For some reason it’s the condiment I always forget. Always a little, but I often think I ought to have added more. The carrots are nicely cooked, but it’s possible that I should have added lemon rind rather than a quarter chunk of full lemon. At least the kitchen is clean. The dishes lasted me this last hour, probably because the roommate who is fond of clean kitchen sinks has left for Naples for the weekend.\n\nI was running around half five, up a hill on the ridge of Rome’s outline, which takes me further away its fickle city centre. I have been on that road in the dark twice now; I went running from this flat’s insularity two days ago, also. The white iron fence was where I turned around, the second time, to head back down, avoiding cars and sneaking under street-lights. The stew I have now is ginger, garlic, onion, carrots, softened potatoes, thyme and oregano, a forgotten spatter of salt!, lentils and spinach, with time and pepper added last. And the quarter chunk of full lemon. Rubbished halfway through. Dishes washed while simmered. Two hasty slices of emmental swiss chess chunked in the chakra, melted and then eaten. Three Italian coffees today, three, one and half-past five. Hours alone where I do not consider which is the most appropriate response.\n\nThere is nothing notable about today. My mother didn’t call. I spent the first nine hours meaning to round off an app; at least, that’s what I had meant the night before. Then four with the obligation. One with the wind. Two with the stew and dishes. One with you. Where did the other one go? I am happy for my existence. I learned today about React, a shift in the rendering technology of our screens — a simplification, even. A way to write more transparently, meaning, with a theoretical paradigm more understandable, to see results more quickly. I ate cold rice, vegetables coupled with soy sauce for my lunch.\n\nNow I mean to read the JavaScript news, a fascinating collection of worlds, articles meant to help this loving, aging. You can pass functions to functions, meaning that you could explain to me your hopes and masturbations which would condition and clarify an explanation of my hopes; and masturbations. It’s not so much in this that I find programming enriching, but it is easier to explain distance by metaphor. Claire texts me sometimes.\n\nShe is studying for an essay she is writing, not in English, but in Chinese. My money stopped working! The bank told me that one of them noticed that I was a fraud; or that there was some sort of fugue they couldn’t account for. They have sent me a new card in the mail, but when I visited the supermarket today (I care for her daily) I could only buy cereal flakes, a chunk of cheese and fondant chocolate! I would not have made the stew had it not, and so I must be glad it did. The stew has rushed into me like ginger.\n\nThough I often think I need to sleep less, I must say that I feel more than ever before that this history will render my present, in the future, something different had this history been another. I wouldn’t have known how to keep myself on all sides, when they sat in the President’s office. I was telling Claire two days ago that this distance affords me social currency hard to find in Princeton’s intoxication. My roommates did not ask me about Paris. Only the internet, where I work these days.\n\nI went running with a sweater. It is that sort of cold here. My own room doesn’t have a heater, to the best of my knowledge, so I am writing to you from a large, oaken table in the clean, kitchen. The gas-lighter we use to ignite the stoves is broken — it doesn’t always work. Sometimes gas creeps against my face, because I am leaning over the stove to see more closely when the fire will catch. My intuition, for some reason, thinks that this will help. I have thought once or twice that if the instrument was broken for long enough, I could set the kitchen on fire for a stew. To date, the fire has kept its peace on the stove-top.\n\nI eat sunflower seeds as a snack during the day now! For the first few hours I did not realize that it is almost as if they are designed to be opened; and so I chewed the shells as well. I keep them in an emptied yoghurt bucket next to my computer, and spit the shells on the upturned lid.\n\nLots of my love,\nLachie\n\n[^exp]:this is a letter i wrote to a friend.\n"

        "date": "16.04.2016",
        "content": "I want to be open source software. It is a better way of creating and maintaining software. Good tech startups iterate quickly, making new versions of their software available to their community, because it is not ideas that make a company successful, but the successful execution of them. Open source philosophy takes community exposure to its extreme; the latest version of you software is *always* available to the community, and asks to be reviewed, improved and expanded.\n\nThe inner details of application logic is available for anyone to see. Pull requests, the means by which someone in the community can request that a feature or improvement they have written be incorporated into the core repository, are regulated, so that the product in its original location cannot be bastardized from its original form -- but there are no secrets. If someone wants to develop on top of the product, they can [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository, and work on the software in a new instance with all the original code.\n\nOpen source software works best when code is well-documented. Good documentation lowers the barrier to entry for people who are interested in contributing, and plays the leading role in demonstrating how the project thinks about itself. This is important, because we cannot constructively suggest anything to anyone unless we have some idea about how they think about themselves, and who they would like to become. From this point, we can offer criticism from a place of mutual understanding, making it much more likely that the suggestion will be swallowed rather than spat out, in turn making the suggestion much more productive.\n\nEven speaking purely from the perspective of self-benefit (a perspective which we have come to understand as 'rationality'), making a project open source entails benefits that are not available to the private alternative. For one, your software is likely to be used a lot more. Software enthusiasts will download your software, because there is no commercial web. People can safely download your software without having to think about whether or not they are making a good move in the game of Capitalism. Moreover, you will hear about problems with your software quicker, and may even have people [fix your problems for you](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+bug+). Not even because you are paying them, they just want to help!\n\nThe most popular place for open source repositories is [github.com](http://www.github.com). Github has wonderful tools that reason about the best ways to collaborate on projects, such as pull request management, standardized ways of merging conflicts, and a wealth of integrations and other support. Traditionally, Github is mostly used with files that contain code, but the services are extensible to any kind of file-based collaboration.\n\nYevgeniy Brikman [writes](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034360.do) that we are all already cyborgs.The technology that we use is an extension of the way we think about ourselves, and of the way that we think about others. This history of messages, notes, profiles and other digital inscriptions enacted by or associated with me is an astonishing large component of my self-consideration, and is no less important than my memory's audiotapes of conversation, the still-frames of pictures I vainly flick through when I feel the need the remind myself how I look, or the video-reel of me turning my head from side to side, etched in mirrors I have pondered at length.\n\nThere are times when I would like to express myself an open source software. My personal website is a project towards that idea. The code that drives it [is open source](http://www.github.com/breezykermo/personalsite), in the traditional sense of the phrase. On a more abstract level, the pieces I write here are an attempt to expose some of my person's code base in the reappropriated medium of writing, and music. Of course, the site is curated. I have personal protocols for the content that I publish here (even if I have not yet spelled them out in words), just as there are protocols for the content that I publish in other self-histories.\n\nWhen I am in an environment, I culture the production of my thoughts so that their expression is more likely to be well received and accepted. (Despite the persistent practice of self-appreciation, I am of course no island, and cannot be without others and their good consideration of me.) At a bar, I compliment people because I want them to like me and complimenting seems like a relatively well accepted way of being liked at bars. At school I try to tread the water between being a good student and being appropriately negligent about study as good students ought to be. When I am working as a freelancer I do my best to make good software because it seems to me that good software is what is required of a good freelancer who is liked by commerciality's Other, the abstract feeling of being culturally valued.\n\nWith this I am publishing the Markdown for all of my blogs on Github, as well as a colleciton of files and folders that attempt to summarize my self-consideration. I have written some Readmes to attempt to define how I feel and think about myself and associated things. Please submit pull requests! You can of course fork my repo if you want to reuse it, because I think we all construct ourselves by borrowing parts of other people.\n\n[Open source me](REPO) is of course not all of who I am, it is just an attempted representation and codification of how I tend to think of myself. It will miss me, overstate me, undermine me, as well as [[all verbs that indicate how produce misrepresents](REPO)] me. Hopefully it will also reinvent me, create me, [[all verbs that indicate constructive change](REPO)] me. Please make me better!\n"

        "content": "My backpack arrived earlier this week. It's 88 litres, and grey. There are no fancy whistles, it is just what it needs to be. I ordered it to the office that Paideia shares with a gaggle of Italian architects. I wasn't there when it arrived, so I picked it up from a nearby UPS access point on a small street the next day. I asked the direction for Viale dei Quattro Venti in Italian as I signed for the package, and I was told to walk to the end of the road and turn either left or right. I must go back there today to sign for the tent I recently ordered.\n\nCome the 3rd of August, I am deprived of my Roman apartment, as the [summer internship](/blog/logistics), my original excuse for being in Rome, officially terminates. Not until September 12th, when the bulk of Paideia returns to Rome and I move in with an Italian homestay, will I again have a roof I can rely on. There is a regional train that leaves from Quattro Venti station that goes to [Viterbo](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Viterbo+VT/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x132f2cf9a622dfcf:0xb50255953c6f6b43?sa=X&ved=0CCsQ8gEwAGoVChMIiNGSkvjwxgIVyzg-Ch1ymgl0), a city to the north of Rome. Between Viterbo and Florence, there is a town called [Arezzo](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Arezzo,+Province+of+Arezzo/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x132bed72f3fda815:0xf846f1b18734dc08?sa=X&ved=0CCwQ8gEwAGoVChMIi8P60-zwxgIVCW0-Ch35EA_Y) -- a small, medieval settlement, known for its university. Davide is a lovely man from whom I have been learning Italian for the past month. He once mentioned that [Siena](https://www.google.it/maps/place/53100+Siena,+Province+of+Siena/@43.3160084,11.3276492,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x132a2cbf34bf5313:0x5d731212f12343e3), a town 200 kilometres west of Arezzo, possesses a beautiful Italian atmostphere, one of Davide's favorite in Italy. An Italian professor from Princeton has kindly put me in touch with some students across Italy, one of whom mentioned in an email that [Cecina](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Cecina+LI/@43.3109943,10.5130485,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x12d5fdf6e921fe71:0xa4f9f917c39f1776) is a lovely beach residence on Italy's west coast. Tracing a finger eastwards from Cecina across Italy, [Ancona](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Ancona/@43.5821499,13.5068264,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x132d802a2447a9c3:0xfad5680543fc5ac) is a port town that services ferries to and from Greece and other Mediterranean ports.\n\nIdeas like these present themselves to my wandering imagination. I am freckled in the mess between New Zealand's case of the great outdoors, Princeton's bucolic ambitions, and Rome's encroaching sense of civilization. Walking sounds nice, provided that there is access to internet for the sake of my wanting to work with software development. For as long as I've been here, the mind and the body have been working in the same office, and the company makes sense this way. Rousseau confesses that he prefers it when both are moving at once, and I feel more attached to his writing than to Socrates, Plato, and other dualists[^1]. My thought feels much more like a landscape than a discrete, linear system. Physics and plate tectonics explain that there are underlying logics to landscapes: cartography and urban planning explain that foundational logics can be built upon. From mathematics, we know that it is occasionally useful to represent a multi-dimensional array as an object of fewer dimesions, as sometimes lower-level transforms are conceptually too complex to perform. It is impossible to consider all the anatomical negotiations contained in the act of moving my hand to pick up a coffee cup, I simply know that my hand is moving to pick up the coffee cup and that is enough. I am already carried away in the dimensions of trying to make a simple point -- I think that I prefer my thought when I feel as though I am moving.\n\nI am now a tutor for [Crimson Consulting](http://nz.crimsonconsulting.org/), an American College Counselling company started by a New Zealander, who is currently studying at Harvard. This work features for me as finance; it allows me to feed myself and pay for the other small expenses that are required of my body and mind. It also allows me to teach, which is difficult to consider as something that is not good. I am tutoring in introductory Computer Science, Web Development, iOS Development, and all of the Cambridge A Levels that I studied at [Auckland Grammar](https://www.ags.school.nz/), including Latin, Classics, English, Music, Physics and Mathematics.\n\nI am thinking about taking an overnight ferry from Ancona to Greece, with my backpack and tent. This would introduce me to the wanderings that follow, the second paragraph. Paideia has a program there in August, with people that I know, and time and place away from Italy could possibly freshen up its little place in my current consideration, like reorganizing the desk space at an office. I am reliant on my ability to be able to find a patch of grass where it will be reasonable to set up my tent. It would be another nice thing if there was internet access, which Greece cannot guarantee; though neither can central Italy's wandering countryside. I am finding, as I practice more of the practices of software developer, the Internet becomes more and more of a thing to keep with me. If for nothing else, it is needed for Skype, as Skype is currently the technical instrument of my wandering's finance. This source could change, but it doesn't need to. Finding a place with internet, food, space for wandering, a sense of civilization, body and mind, faces, history, bucolic ambition and freckled outdoors doesn't seem too much to ask for, does it?\n\n[^1]: Though, Lucretius had a good thing going, as Michel Serres picks up the pieces with his own senses of it. I am not sure exactly where I stand, but I do like Serres' impressions of the body, despite that I have learned them through words.\n"

In the same way the users of social codes turn them into metaphors and ellipses of their own quests.**\n\nand the earth:\n\n>\"The earth is the spontaneous forthcoming of that which is continually self-secluding and to that extent sheltering and concealing\"[^2].\n\ni think if i had leaned over and kissed her when she was showing me the pics of her choir, when she was younger, my murky desires would have become spontaneously clear. <br>\nheidegger continues:\n\n>\"world and earth are essentially different from one another and yet are never seperated. The world grounds itself on the earth, and earth juts through the world. But the relation between world and earth does not wither away into the empty unity of opposites unconcerned with one another. The world, in resting upon the earth, strives to surmount it\"[^2].\n\ncudos to the world last night for triumphing over the earth.\n\n>\"As self-opening [the world] cannot endure anything closed. The earth, however, as sheltering and concealing, tends always to draw the world into itself and keep it there\"[^2].\n\nas with all successful academics, marty's answer is\n'yes and no'.\nin the limited case of my last-night, the earth wouldn't let the world get out, and the world did its best to ignore the injunctions of the earth. in their contention\n\n>\"the opponents raise each other into the self-assertion of their natures\"[^2].\n\nfor work:\n\n>\"In setting up a world and setting forth the earth, the work is an instigation of this striving. This does not happen so that the work should at the same time settle and put an end to the conflict of an insipid agreement, but so that the strife may remain a strife.\"\n\nart (that lonely moment where i want what did or didn't happen to have an other recognition) curates and frames the world's squabble with the earth, like a snapchat catching my eyes on the nape of her neck, while she laughs at something her friend said.\n\n>\"It is because the struggle arrives at its high point in the **simplicity of intimacy** that the unity of the work comes about in the fighting of the battle. The fighting of the battle is the continually self-overreaching gathering of the work's agitation. The repose of the work that rests in itself thus has its presencing in the intimacy of the striving.\"[^7].\n\ni'm a little loathe to suddenly make this a battle, marty - we certainly could have avoided the conflict had we just been clear in the first place. but i do agree that the intimacy would have had more *presence* had we ever made it through the conflict of earth and world.\n\n**the viewer reads the landscape of his childhood in the evening news.**\n\nheidegger goes on to talk about concealment, which i don't want to denigrate by considering in the light of my internal romantics. i do not want to transfix his philosophy in my own consideration, but only to pour it inside my example intimacy to capitalize on my own understanding. if i take martin's phrases without this context, i can't get anything from him. he's no equipment. i have no mind to get caught up in the analytics of his philosophical ideals. that\n\n>\"Truth, in its nature, is un-truth\"[^8]\n\njust sinks straight to the bottom, without a buoy from my own happenings.\n\ni would much rather work with light attire\nand make a generally, efficient, imprint\nthan weigh\nheavy\non everyone\nand do a really very good job of being absolutely specific.\n\n\n>\"Indeed we achieve our most primordial (closest) relationship with equipment not by looking a the entity in question, or by some detached intellectual or theoretical study of it, but rather by skilfully manipulating it in a hitch-free manner\"[^9].\n\nthis is to say, i got a little lost in the middle of marty's essay, when he started talking about truth. it seemed as though his mind-and-not-his-body was at one of those networking events that happen for the investment bank agencies, ensuring to spend equal time between beauty, truth, and art, and innovatively wrestling with all of their normal questions in such a way that his essentially normal answers impressed; to be fair to martin, though, i know nothing about asset management.\n\nmaybe it is important.\n\n**The thin film of writing becomes a movement of strata, a play of spaces.**\n\ni loaded the stanford encyclopaedia of philosophy's primary article on marty and his philosophy on my computer screen. this tells me that in order to grasp his later philosophy, i really ought to first become thoroughly familiar with his magnum opus, '*being and time \\| time and being*'. there is something called *da sein* that is important to his phenomenology, whose projects and possiblities are bound up in the ways in which other entities may become intelligible, in publics, performativity, and the essence of ourselves scattered in the world.\n\n**He insinuates into another person's text the ruses of pleasure and appropriation: he poaches on it, is transported into it, pluralizes himself in it like the internal rumblings of one's body.**\n\nso i wandered to '*building, thinking, dwelling*', a text for which every thing gathers in something called the fourfold. was there nothing of simplicity in your desires, marty? no basic kisses for which semantics were unnecessarily complicated?\n\nis this what you call thinking?\n\nis this where you dwell?\n\nis this where language dwells for you?\n\nis this to talk about philosophical architecture only by way of the sky's metaphor?\n\nis this the bridge, holding up the sky and gathering the earth as landscape around the stream?\n\n**Renters make comparable changes in an apartment they furnish with their acts and memories; as do speakers, in the language into which they insert both the messages of their native tongue and, through their accent, through their own \"turns of phrase,\" etc., their own history; as do pedestrians, in the streets they fill with the forests of their desires and goals.**\n\n\n - - - - -\n\n\nall bolded quotes taken from: decertau, michel.

(i find my words do little more than listen. i was never raised a preacher. i am only just beginning to understand academics.) this body has recently moved through rome -> bari -> patras -> selianitika -> patras -> ancona -> bologna -> arezzo -> firenze -> bologna -> milano -> turino -> cinque terre -> siena -> arezzo, and is soon to be back in rome. it is now, or soon, or now that i begin my residency, as an italian child in the shape of a moderately kept man.\n\nin the library of this wooden desk's house, i found a book on ezra pound. for broadcasting negative impressions of the united states from italy, he was tried in 1945. it was concluded that he was insane.\n\n>The defendant, now sixty years of age and in generally good physical condition, was a precocious student, specialising in literature. He has been a voluntary expatriate for nearly forty years, living in England and France and for the past twenty-one years in Italy, making an uncertain living by writing poetry and criticism. His poetry and literary criticism have received considerable recognition, but in recent years his preoccupation with monetary theory and economics has apparently obstructed his literary productivity. He has long been recognized as eccentric, querolous, and egocentric. At the present time, he exhibits extremely poor judgement as to his situation. He insists that his broadcasts were not treasonable but that all of his radio activities have stemmed from his self-appointed mission to ‘save the Constitution.’ He is abnormally grandiose, is expansive and exuberant in manner, exhibiting pressure of speech, discursiveness, and distractibility.\n\n>In our opinion, with advancing years his personality, for many years abnormal, has undergone further distortion to the extent that he is now suffering from a paranoid state which renders him mentally unfit to advise properly with counsel or to participate reasonably and intelligently in his own defence. He is, in other words, insane and mentally unfit for trial, and in need of care in a mental hospital.[^2]\n\nas a poet, i do not think i am wrong to say that pound's first preoccupation was with language. he prefers the cadences of language, rather than its specification, because if description is desired, \"the painter can describe a landscape much better than [the poet] can\"[^7]. when some ambiguity presents itself, for example when we confuse an object's attribution with a different subject, there are overtones in the chord language strikes with its receiver, and its reception can become confused with its importance. what is said is barely ever monumental, despite our cult(ure) of text. in italy's academic institutions, exams for literature are oral. words disappear as soon as they are spoken, like the listening to a concert that is not recorded. (do those concerts happen these days?). mr pound lived in italy for 20 years. reading paradise lost, a text which pound deplored, aloud in recent days, i often forget the content in favor of the meter's charm, eating an apple for its sweet distraction not its nutrition, sleeping with a girl for her skin not for her soul. is this my quotidian? \"let the candidate fill his mind with the finest cadences he can discover, preferably in a foreign language, so that the meaning of the words may be less likely to divert his attention from the movement.\"[^4]\n\ni take to pound's move away from abstraction, in favor of a \"direct treatment of the 'thing', whether subjective or objective\"[^8]. companies in new zealand tend to be locally focused, because the economy is small, and imported goods are expensive on account of the country's floating, geographical isolation from the rest of the world. some people say that new zealanders are generally kinder for this reason; because networks are more intimate, unkind conduct does not get you very far, in business, and in un-business. moreover, i am much more confident talking to one person than to fifteen. it is in these crowds that i feel abstraction congealing, for fear that treatment more direct might upset someone. i think i would enjoy returning to new zealand, to work as a coder in a small business, improving internal operations with locally specific programs and scripts. once i am done with this education's insanity, i will be promptly there.\n\npound translated texts in chinese, provencal, greek, latin, occitan, egyptian, some other languages and also italian. it seems he wanted to recreate the musicality of those languages in english, the apple-sweet cadences of their skin. he claims no interest in art or aesthetics: \"i would much rather lie on what is left of catullus' parlour floor and speculate the azure beneath it and the hills off to salo and riva with their forgotten gods moving unhindered amongst them, than discuss any processes and theories of art whatsoever. i would rather play tennis. i shall not argue.\"[^5] these things don't really amount to anything, as such. pound has medically been proven crazy, after all. i do like the fact that pound likes to play tennis.\n\nmy residency, then, begins as an italian child in the shape of a moderately kept man. i am becoming interested in mussolini, as he is a champion of classical virtue. so too is the company i am working for, the paideia institute. to study fascism is not to practice it, i don't think, but i will be cautious nevertheless. cautious like in a butterfly migration watched with a sometimes-stunning redhead. coding, i don't know how you fit.\n\ntranslating, from arezzo to you.\n\n[^2]: G.S.

I am working for the [Paideia Institute](https://www.paideiainstitute.org) in Rome from June 3rd though July 31st, as a digital humanities intern. With one other technical intern and three other classicists, I am helping to develop two applications for iPhone and iPad that are geared towards students of Latin and the Classics. In addition to this, Paideia has recently signed up for a content management system called Nationbuilder, a web-based community manager intended for non-profit organizations. I'm essentially managing the technical dimension of this migration, which involves restyling the Paideia website on Nationbuilder's web development framework, and recreating Paideia's web operations within Nationbuilder's framework. They're currently using a bunch of different applications, such as Google Forms, PayPal and MailChimp. Nationbuilder theoretically integrates all of these services into one, though the technical reality is a little more complicated.\n\nFrom August 3rd until September 12th, I’m thinking of backpacking around Italy during this time, and spending some time in the towns around Rome, though I haven’t worked anything in particular out.\n\nFrom September 12th through October 31st, Paideia will set me up with an Italian homestay in Rome. During that time, Paideia will also set me up with Italian classes that I will take with the three other Rome fellows for three hours a day, something like five days a week. Paideia's Rome fellowship is an initiative that officially started last year. The fellows  are typically Classics majors who have just graduated college. They spend time in Rome at Paideia’s expense learning Italian and the sites of the city, and they then give tours for Paideia’s high school programs later in the year.\n\nIn November, I'll find an apartment/residence in Rome where I can live independently, which will ideally be a living environment where I can continue to practise my Italian. I'll be working with Paideia for this duration, tweaking the website, managing technical projects as they come, etc. I won’t necessarily be staying in Rome from this point on, though I will be regularly checking in with the Paideia staff and fellows in Rome (there are roughly 6 of us in total here next year), for at least three or four hours a week. These terms of agreement will continue through until at least March, at which point I'll reevaluate, and maybe do something else.\n\nThroughout this time in Rome, I will be studying texts in a syllabus I'm generating for myself through conversations with friends, professors and other mentors. The two founders of Paideia, Jason Pedicone and Eric Hewett, both have Princeton PhDs in Classics, and they will serve as mentors and hosts in my autodidactic pilgrimage[^1]. For my current thoughts on what this syllabus will look like, see [syllabus](/blog/syllabus). It's more than anything the vague idea of a reading list at the moment; it will doubtless change and adapt as my mind and thoughts change.\n\nIf you're interested in the reasons for my pilgrimage, see [reasons](/blog/reasons).\n\n[^1]: This seems an appropriately interrogative title. We can talk about the hubris, blasphemy and pretention later.\n"

For the past year or so, I have been using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static pages, and then hosting those pages as a [static site via an Amazon S3 Bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html). This worked fairly well. Jekyll transforms Markdown to HTML, and also allows you to write inline HTML, so if I wanted to put anything 'webby' in my blogs (e.g. an iframe, colors, a decorated modal), I could just write it into a standard page using HTML. I'm not invested in or excited by Jekyll, so I didn't bother to read up too much on its ins and outs: I just ran it in the command line, and dumped the static files to my bucket.\n\nAs I am becoming more interested in [Go](https://golang.org/), I decided to switch my site to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static engine that seems faster and more flexible, in comparison with Jekyll. As I started playing around with it, I realised that I wanted my front end in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I've been using the front end framework for virtually all my projects these days, because it is compatible with [declarative JavaScript](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95), and works nicely in tandem with the wild and revolutionary [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux), in which I adore programming, for more complex projects.\n\nI started playing around with the [React static boilerplate on Yeoman](https://github.com/koistya/react-static-boilerplate), and quickly came up with a fast-moving simple site. Wanting to make as many of my React components [stateless and functional](https://medium.com/@joshblack/stateless-components-in-react-0-14-f9798f8b992d), I started factoring text and other content, and decided to switch to my [react | redux boiler](https://github.com/breezykermo/react-redux-boiler), because I'm familiar with the code[^1]. I sometimes use Redux state management even in simple sites, as it just makes state management easy; if I want a rotating gear at the bottom of the screen that animates between page turns and displays info, the Redux store keeps track of everything, and I just dispatch actions when I want it to update[^2].\n\nBecause my site is in part a blog, I need visitors to be able to enter it from more than one URL path (e.g., [www.lachlankermode.com/blog/history-falling-apart](http://www.lachlankermode.com/blog/history-falling-apart), [www.lachlankermode.com/resume](http://www.lachlankermode.com/resume)), which I can't do with a client-hosted React site, as routing is handled via client-side JavaScript, not by a folder directory that just serves the file at the appropriate route when requested. So I added [server-side rendering](https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/redux-server-rendering-react-router-universal-web-app) to the project, to preload the relevant state given the nature of the visitor's request on the server, and then serve to the client the appropriate JavaScript. The [example setup I worked with](https://github.com/StevenIseki/react-router-redux-example) asychronously fetches data and flushes it into the redux state before serving files to the client, and given I'll potentially want to load data from separate asynchronous sources into my site in the future, I decided to take the extra half hour and set up my site with that capability as well. I rewrote my [blogs and static pages as JSON](https://github.com/breezykermo/lachlankermode.com/tree/master/src/api/data), and switched to loading them asynchronously into Redux state via an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) API.\n\nTo host my server, I created an [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image[^3] from the [mhart/alpine-node](https://github.com/mhart/alpine-node) base image (thinner than the official Node image), and pushed it to Docker Hub. Amazon's [Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html) is an easy way to run Docker containers from images that exist in the Docker Hub repo[^4]. Additionally, my domain's nameservers were already pointed to my AWS account through [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/), because I had previously been hosting my site through an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket, so it was a breeze to direct traffic at [lachlankermode.com](http://www.lachlankermode.com) to my new Elastic Beanstalk container (update: am now hosting through [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)).\n\nAfter the weekend's work, I am out the other side with a speedy new site, and an [undocumented, scatterbrained React | Redux blog engine](https://github.com/breezykermo/lachlankermode.com) that has no test suite. When I was foraying into web development two years ago at my regular cafe in Princeton, NJ, I resolved to write my entire site from scratch as a pedagogical exercise. Two years later, at the wooden table in my apartment where I live with Italian male nurses, I have completed my project -- sort of.\n\nHere's the start of my site's long to-do list:\n\n - Sort out dev environment; it's a mess.\n - Comment code.\n - Write a test suite.\n - Remedy hacks that are all over the place.\n - Refactor React components to make more sense\n - Allow for interactive resume editing ([halfway there](https://github.com/breezykermo/lachlankermode.com/tree/master/src/resume))\n - Code an admin site, with blog editor.\n - interactive archive!\n\nOn my old site, I [mentioned](/blog/the-coming-archive) that I was working on a interactive, personal archive. This upgrade is moving towards that realization. The data for the archive will be stored via the Express API, and it will be displayed via a section of the current site.\n\nI'm not specifically planning to make this blog engine into a platform, although if it advances far enough, I might consider it in the future (because everyone wants a React | Redux blog for their personal site, right?). Hit me up on Twitter [@lachlankermode](https://twitter.com/lachlankermode) or via [email](mailto:lachlankermode@live.com?Subject=here%20are%20my%20thoughts) if you have questions or comments.\n\nbreeze and be well.\n\n\n[^1]: Another great thing about React is that it's wild easy to migrate components and even entire sections of projects to other projects, especially if you're abiding by functional paradigms. Later on in this narrative, I literally drag-and-dropped some an [over-powered resume component](https://github.com/breezykermo/resume) I wrote about a week ago into the site, did a tiny bit of configuration to connect the disparate redux reducers, and I was good to go. This would be even easier if I had written the above-stated resume component as an npm module, or added one more layer of abstraction at the top level.\n\n[^2]: I'm not going to dive into Redux here. [Read the docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/) if you're interested, they are sublime.\n\n[^3]: Seriously check Docker out if you don't know about it, it's incredible. [Here's a good article](http://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-docker-and-why-is-it-so-darn-popular/) to get started.\n\n[^4]: and they also have their own Docker repo, [Amazon EC2 Container Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html). I thought about hosting my container through the newly birthed [dockercloud](https://cloud.docker.com/container/list/), the progeny of the soon-to-be-late [Tutum](https://www.tutum.co/), but found its infrastructure to be too comprehensive and complicated for my needs. I just wanted a single container, from a single image, with no volumes or networks or other complexities.\n"

        "content": "In a beach-house my family used to visit on Waiheke Island, I remember throwing myself against waves in the ocean as they are crashing. I like the pressure. I think I have decided it meant agency. There is little scarier to me than being carried away by a momentum, instead of throwing myself against it. I am not someone who wants to ride on particular expectations, but instead I like to be the meeting point of many. On Waiheke Island, I would keep throwing myself into waves for hours, until I was tired and ready to go home.\n\nThere is something of a need to move in me. A standard reflection I recite about myself recalls the tripartite identity I performed in high school. One part of me played Water Polo, another sang in the choir and on stage, and the third liked to read, write and practise Latin. A self composed in three threads is suggestively religious, but unflatteringly the only idols I can claim to have worshipped are individualism and its self-regarding companions. I tell myself sometimes that I think about myself too much, and that usually results in thinking about whether I might make myself into something else, whether I should, whether I will will I? Now that I am no longer in high school there are more than three threads in the fabric of myself that I am weaving for the world, and so this is where we're at currently: writing an essay about me, in an attempt to explain and unravel the economy of desires trusts loves likes mistrusts flaws failures I call my self.\n\nTaking a year away from university study is an experimental gesture. For what reasons do I read? For whom do I develop software? Why am I working? I feel as though Princeton has already decided its answers for these questions, and I don't know that my answers are the same. I think they are _probably_ similar, but I haven't had the informed time or space to be anywhere close to sure. One of my good friends told me that I am still very young, and I agree with her. While I am young, my experiments are creative and curious. When I am old, they will be wayward and disreputable[^1].\n\nI am a ghost-body of ideas. The [people with whom I work](http://www.paideiainstitute.org/about/) would maybe prefer _eidolon_, a Greek word that Wiktionary tells me means \"An image or representation of an idea... an apparition of some actual or imaginary entity, or some aspect of reality.\"[^2] I take notes for books, thoughts and everything else on an application called [Growly Notes](http://www.growlybird.com/notes/), which allows the tapping of anywhere to start writing in a text box, drag arrows across the screen, color code and other useful things. It is possible to move text boxes once created, which immerses my thought in a slightly more fluid culture of representation than if I was taking notes on a page. It is the tool by which I organize and disorganize ideas, a forum for their reinterpretation.\n\nInstitutional education submerges in a viscous liquid that only allows certain types of thought gestures. Though it is undoubtedly important to learn how to swim when one is in one's youth, it's not particularly useful if you don't know how to mobilize in any other way. Swimming can only take us so far. I'm not all about distance and finish lines. When I go running I do not like to know how much further I have to go. Two days ago I lost my direction in the [Villa Doria Pamphili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Doria_Pamphili). I had to keep going, because I don't have the cash in my back pocket to call a cab, or the faith to stop and walk. I came to this park with a purpose, and I (probably) won't stop until I know what it is.\n\nPrinceton's liberal arts degree in Computer Science is broad, and I am able to take many courses that wouldn't be available to me in a British-based system of tertiary education[^3]. Princeton's requirements cannot keep my course of study broad enough, because, as I have admitted, I am still not completely sure what I am studying for. A year to study on my own time, kept tidy by my own mind, will at least give perspective to the sort of study I will return to at Princeton. In Rome I intend to read authors whose names I have heard but do not know, to learn Italian in an attempt to diversify and complexify the syntax of my thought, to develop a portfolio of software and programs I have not yet heard of, and to write music. For more about this, see [syllabus](/blog/syllabus).\n\nThis is sort of where I am at. Rome gives time to give Princeton perspective. There also don't have to be teleologies, even if I wrote an essay fictionalizing some. Hopefully reading feels a little bit like throwing yourself into waves. We will keep doing it until we are tired and ready to go home.\n\n[^1]: This is **youth** as it features in Wilde's _The Picture of Dorian Gray_, and also in Spielberg's _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_. We want it we have it we lose it we want it.\n[^2]: Wiktionary, [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eidolon ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eidolon), accessed 02/07/2015 at 4:33pm.\n[^3]: As we have in New Zealand.'\n"

        "content": "it's supposed to be fairly straightforward, the process of taking notes to remember what i read. my memory is fragile. it can never recall the words it wants, nor the names nor, god forgive, the dates. to insure my mind, broken from the beginning, against the future, to stimulate my memory when it lazes -- there are notes.\n\ni have been reading a world history textbook, to refurnish some of the rooms in my head, in some style that differs from contemporaneity's desperate pleas for attention. halfway through the rise of islam, i wondered why i was recording the names of the three most prominent rulers in the Abbasid dynasty --\n\nwondering 'why' at this juncture has distracted me sufficiently from history to write a trite something about the other rooms that decorate my thought, a thematic trend in my conflict with words.\n\n-- provided the world of data persists, these names will be virtually at hand in the open hood of an internet connection. is the taking of a note, the 'download to desktop', a significant transaction? lusting for the mindless literary absorption of proper youth[^1], i doubt academic diligence is necessary. although, history's names are important to know from paper and screen.\n\nthis confusion applies elsewhere, too, with my kindle. in the intervening trams, between office and office (my home i carry with me), i take breaks from watching people pass in anna karenina and emerson. it is logistically unsavory to both read, and take notes while standing in the bustle of daily rome. my absorption is left to its labour, in the case of tolstoy. forgetting to transcribe its acknowledgement in fitted wallpaper. preferring instead a mess of household items on the floor. this literature is not history.\n\nthe more confused comes with software. in the land where i come across computers, knowledge is etched in experiments and practice, as the written records are notoriously incomplete and difficult to read. the notes are a reference and no guide. (it is dante who takes vergil to hell; most of us are only given satan.) i don't take notes for my software, because computers have rid me of the need. they store every information in an abstract symbol table, and i no longer have need of paper's space. only excessive associations.\n\nwalter ong's 'orality and literacy' proves the mind is capable of adequate memory, in exchange for the textual trinkets of modern expression. right now, though, this style of mind does not seem to be in vogue. it has no memory of darwin's adaptive injunction, for example, and also must be prepared to consistently admit; it does not know everything. i think it has a certain sex appeal at parties. it can be both the subject and object of gendered domination. no romance languages that i know (though i have never really known any) accomodate this flexibility. there is little sexier to me than a concept that does not need words[^2].\n\ni am not sure which mind mine is. ideally, of course, i would have a room for everything. but i have never been quite able to trust plato's sense of things, meaning that i have never quite been able to clean the mess and keep my mind in reasoned, ethical order. i came across a 16th century map of the world where north and south were inverted. my italy, greece and china changed. on the contrary, without my foreknowledge an italian lady cleaned and folded the relatively messy room i call mine at my homestay this yesterday, and i enjoyed the folded clothes. i didn't want to mention they were on the floor because they were used. it seemed cruel to undo her work's intent. the notes i take when reading are more often a beer coaster where i can spill distractions than they are a clean meal consumed with candid cutlery. despite, my habit harks to hold them to the former.\n\nmy memory is fragile. i read this text back over to see why i started writing. repetition does good things to bring me back, and my notes are useful for this kind of reflective future. one something that developed from islam (i remember without having to turn anywhere) is sufism. the overview in writing was very brief, but the claim is that love is greater than intellect. i take this to mean that we find unexpected futures more enlightening than recollected pasts. the mind where i find myself forgetful is in ... present.\n\n[^1]: i recommend 'The Redemption of Althalus' by David and Leigh Eddings.\n[^2]: i am no universal phenomenon !! people may keep their preferences.',\n}'''"

        "title": "Syllabus",
        "date": "02.07.2015",
        "content": "I\\'ve decided there will be four sides in my course of study for the following year. Each side has an incentive, and the sides are not necessarily self-contained. Though I am interested in reviewing and interrogating its typical structure, my study this year will still, at least initially, be parameterized by goal-based coursework and reading lists.\n\nThe first two of four sides come from a piece of writing I composed at the boarding gate in JFK Airport, just before I flew to Rome on June 3rd, 2015. When I move places, I like to write something either side of the shift. My memory feels more carefully tuned to location, era and affect than to dates, facts and politics. On the threshold of spaces, I seem compelled to transform affect into writing and words, maybe only because I have been told it is an appropriate forum for ideas, and because I have gotten into the habit of it. Maybe this is a reappropriated brand of piety, because I was clearly not cut out to be a nun. On Rome\\'s threshold, I decided that I would gear myself towards finding two things on its continent: first, a proficiency in **the Italian language**, and second, the ability to develop **web and iOS software**. My expectations for the acquisition of these things was contained to the original three months I knew I would be staying in Italy; but now that I have finalized this holiday\\'s extension, they are being made into sides of my year\\'s syllabus. During this summer internship with [Paideia](http://www.paideiainstitute.org), I have four hour-long Italian classes a week, and from mid-September I will begin having three-hour-long classes, five days a week (see [logistics](/blog/logistics)). At other times I am listening to conversations on the Metro, learning vocabulary through a wonderful app called [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/), and participating in the range of other immersions and exercises that naturally take place when one is living in Rome.\n\nMy [continued involvement with Paideia](/blog/logistics) is the ground for explorations in the world of Web and iOS development, as Web and iOS development are currently the two things I do for Paideia. In addition to this work, I\\'m starting projects with friends across the globe. Often we are developing locally useful and and not-terribly-complex tools, and in other cases I am developing just for the sake of having collaborative playgrounds in unfamiliar frameworks. As the summer closes, I\\'ll be looking to contract work as a freelance developer, as by then I\\'ll have a couple of iOS applications and a website or two shipped, and which I can use as part of a portfolio. In my current projects, I am using Django, AngularJS, Swift/Xcode, and a few smaller assistant things like Foundation, Jekyll, Gulp and Node. I\\'m not trying to order these frameworks in any sort of sequential syllabus; I\\'m learning them as a consequence of the projects that I\\'m looking to undertake. This approach is more in line with the pragmatics of web development. It is at once free-spirited and directed as form of governance, and it gives my course of study a sense of purpose that isn\\'t quite so tightly bound to institutional methodology, but instead takes more after itself[^3].\n\nAs I mention in [reasons](/blog/reasons), Princeton\\'s Computer Science syllabus does not by nature include a great amount of historical, philosophical or literary material. Despite having no specific vocational interest in these fields, I still find myself eager to study their material. It is strange to express this desire to the adult world, as the contemporary media of success do not crave those things that will not specifically make their actors successful. This is maybe why I crave those things, as a sort of _stfu_ in response to vocational requirements. Pairing this desire with an immanent and imminent lack of historical knowledge, I will be reading prescriptively in two areas over the course of this year, that I have fancied calling **history of ideas**, and **history of events**[^1]. My history of ideas reading list is a synthesized score of recommendations that have been made to me over the past two years by friends, professors, and society at large. It is notably eurocentric, a prejudice I may look to combat as I work my way through its beginnings. A woman and professor whom I greatly respect helped me to categorize this list by its ideas. I am thinking, often, I will most likely deviate and read something simply because it strikes me as relevant or interesting. I\\'ve only composed the beginning of this reading list, the first ten selections, and it may mutate before I get through even those authors.\n\nTo study a history of events, I have a world history textbook waiting for me on my desk, for when I leave this cafe and make it to the regular day this morning. Beyond and beside this textbook, I have been recommended a book on the history of 19th century Italy, and another on fascism through Hitler and Mussolini. A friend has often mentioned her enamorment with Tacitus\\' mode of historical recreation, and so a return to those First Historians -- Tacitus, Livy, Herodotus, etc -- may find its way into this task of reading.\n\nIt also may not. I expect that many of these purposes will peel away, remain unfinished, and be abandoned. More than becoming knowledged and being able to pompously claim that I have read the Greats, and therefore lay claim to being a literate person as proven by the Required Standards of Knowledge, this reading is to trace and think about the reasons why I read. Is it to frame writing? Is it to contribute to academia\\'s body of knowledge, as Princeton\\'s mandatory [Writing Seminar](http://www.princeton.edu/writing/seminars/) is so keen to suggest to its disciples? Is it for no pragmatic reason at all, and simply for _inconsequential_ happiness or joy? Is it only because of Princeton\\'s excessively academic environment that I feel the need to read, to claim education and educatedness? Is reading not meaningful to me at all outside of a socially academic context? I have these questions at the moment.\n\nAt Princeton, I stitched coursework into my life and my life into coursework with music. In those experimental gestures, I wrote lyrics that tried to understand the way I was feeling about people and my place with them through essays and books. When I was reading for a class titled _German Intellectual History: The Cultural Theory of the Frankfurt School_, I wrote a song to search for sex in Adorno and Benjamin and to search for Adorno and Benjamin in sex[^2]. I think I will keep looking to music to join things together here, but I don\\'t feel as though I need to include it in this syllabus, for it will naturally happen as a consequence of thinking and owning a guitar.\n\n[^1]: I thought about capitalizing these categories, but I\\'m currently in the middle of extensive negotiations with Capitalization. It might be related to my institutional need for institutional avoidance; sometimes capitals just don\\'t do it for me, and words seem more appropriate in little letters.\n[^2]: This second expression is not very flattering. I understand. It represents my thoughts at the time, though; sex was a complicated thing for me. The song is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1To04RRp98), if you\\'d like to listen.\n[^3]: What does this mean? I\\'m not sure, you\\'re sort of at liberty to decide.\n''''"

Many concepts and activities in the constellation I consider myself can be ontologically traced to some kind of romantic origin. This may be because I am the son of a loving, wealthy and white family, a family that made my every movement feel successful and validated. My main recollection of inadequacy and self-doubt is bound up in politics outside of a family vehicle, the trials and tribulations of my high school sweet-hearts.\n\nShe wrote diary entries daily. I aspired to her emotional outlook, and took to the same practice, for 16 months. The first page of my second volume describes what words I could put to paper after having sex for the first time. I stopped writing, eventually, because I couldn\\'t keep my own interest; I wondered what use strained sentences describing daily ritual would be, and was no longer excited by the exercise of repeating the day in effervescent words, repeatedly, every evening. I stopped dating the girl.\n\nIn my first couple of years at university, I economised time (so seemingly scarce in those days) and wrote notes to myself when I had a thought I thought was worth remembering. Every fortnight or so, I would stretch the notes to paragraphs, modelling moments through language\\'s logical structure, remembering time and what space I had of it in the reflection of a plastic coffee container at *Small World*, my regular morning cafe. I lost some of these pieces, as I understood technology even less than I do today, but others I still have. One I used to apply for a creative writing seminar. I was not accepted.\n\nDuring this time, I also bootstrapped a website to exhibit artefacts of my creation and curation; books, music, theatre, academic papers, non-academic papers, the recurrent thoughts that congealed as worldy memory. I wanted words to confuse the narrative that separated my 6AM coffee from my 9AM lecture, my 12PM lunch from my 3PM seminar, my 6PM dinner from my 9PM rehearsal, my 12AM pregames from my 3AM sex. Eventually, I learned to take care not to implicate others\\' privates in what has now congealed as a project to evaporate parts of my own in the internet\\'s public.\n\nThis archive is a continuation of that project. Because of its emergent nature, the earlier years of this archive keep different kinds of data than the present, and the future years will likely keep different data than the present. The information this online repository contains is incomplete, cross-referenced, and riddled with inconsistency. There are multiple systematics of retrieval, no unified logic of organization or presentation; and hopefully many other indescribable and unquantifiable complexities that recognize the *fact* that I, as a person, am only organized to an extent. The rest is an excess, and there is no end to the ways in which I confuse myself by, via, with, through, against, beneath, and over the material I have produced.\n'"
