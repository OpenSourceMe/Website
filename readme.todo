--- refactor reducers completely, to match github json structure.
--- make a responsive top nav, for god's sake
---- need to write assertion tests for the data that is coming from github (REALLY IMPORTANT, as fetches from the wrong url will case website to completely break)
- test suite should be more comprehensive (as always)
- refactor README for OpenSourceMe speak
- ./src/components/Portfolio.jsx should be reading dynamically from OpenSourceMe repo
